### Refactor
* BREAKING CHANGE: The value .global.replicated.dockerconfigjson was not actually overrideable.  We have added .global.dockerconfigjson so you can override the pull secrets to be used
### Bugfix
* Ensure elasticsearch secret name is actually configurable and the chart still works properly when it is configured
### Dependency
* Update replicated sdk version from 1.0.0-beta.17 to 1.0.0-beta.20
